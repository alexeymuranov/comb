### [Toulouse Mathematics Institute](http://math.univ-toulouse.fr), 24th-28th of June 2013

Over the last few years, spectacular progress has been made in geometry and topology (the Poincaré conjecture, Thurston's geometrisation conjecture, the classification of hyperbolic manifolds, Marden's conjecture, infinite virtual Betti numbers, the P property for knots, the virtual fibration conjecture, Heegaard-Floer homology, quantum invariants, curve complexes…).

On the occasion of Michel Boileau's 60th birthday, the [Toulouse Mathematics Institute](http://math.univ-toulouse.fr) is organising an international meeting, **Low-dimensional Topology and Geometry in Toulouse**, that will take place in Toulouse from the 24th to the 28th of June 2013.

The main central theme will be **low-dimensional topology** (especially dimension 3), but the meeting will cover a wide range of topics:

* **hyperbolic and differential geometry**
* **knot theory**
* **applications of geometric group theory and representation varieties**

The conference will form part of the scientific activites of the thematic month [Topology, Symplectic and Contact Geometry in Toulouse](http://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/top-geom-conf-2013/common/index.php?lang=en),
organised by the [International Center of Mathematics and Computer Science in Toulouse (CIMI)](http://www.cimi.univ-toulouse.fr/). The meeting will
also receive financial support from the [Toulouse Mathematics Institute](http://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/), [Paul Sabatier University](http://www.univ-tlse3.fr/), the [GDR "Tresses"](http://tresses.math.cnrs.fr/), the [GEAR Network](http://gear.math.illinois.edu), and the three ANR projects [Extension of Teichmueller-Thurston theories](http://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/~schlenker/ettt/ettt.html), [Contact topology in higher dimensions](http://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/~niederkr/ANR/index.php?frame=main) and [Geometry of subgroups](http://www.cmi.univ-mrs.fr/~paoluzzi/gsg.xhtml).
