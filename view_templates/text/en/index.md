<!-- Topology Conference in Toulouse -->
### [Toulouse Mathematics Institute](http://math.univ-toulouse.fr), 24th-28th of June 2013

Over the last few years, spectacular progress has been made in the areas
of geometry and topology (the Poincaré conjecture, Thurston's
geometrisation conjecture, the classification of hyperbolic manifolds,
Marden's conjecture, infinite virtual Betti numbers, the virtual
fibration conjecture, Heegaard-Floer homology, quantum invariants, curve
complexes…). The international meeting **Low-dimensional Topology and
Geometry in Toulouse**, which will take place on the occasion of Michel
Boileau's 60th birthday, will be devoted to some of these aspects. The
main general topics of the conference will be:

* **low-dimensional topology** (especially dimension 3)
* **hyperbolic and differential geometry**
* **knot theory**
* **applications of geometric group theory and representation theory**

The conference will form part of the scientific activites of the thematic
month [Topology, Symplectic and Contact Geometry in
Toulouse](http://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/top-geom-conf-2013/common/index.php?lang=en),
organised by the [International Center of Mathematics and Computer Science
in Toulouse (CIMI)](http://www.cimi.univ-toulouse.fr/). The meeting will
also receive financial support from the [Toulouse Mathematics
Institute](http://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/), [Paul Sabatier
University](http://www.univ-tlse3.fr/) and the [GDR
"Tresses"](http://tresses.math.cnrs.fr/).
